A newly developed spam-filtering algorithm is implemented in all the email user accounts of a corporate office.  Based on a {\bf  total of 1354 external emails} received in the first few days, the company summarized the following data to evaluate its performance.  \\
Among the 1354 emails that are considered it appears that  in actuality (TRUTH),  there is a total of 271 spam emails while the rest of the external emails are not spam.  The Spam-filtering algorithm  predicts  and labels an external email  to be  either a Spam (`Positive' for spam ) email or a `Not-Spam' (`Negative' for Spam').

This problem pertains to the dataset on the O-Ring failure of the Space Shuttles. It was known that there is an association between the O-Ring seal failure and the low atmosphere temperature during the corresponding shuttle launch. The variable “oringFail" in the data set indicates whether the shuttle experienced an O-ring failure during its launch. The “temperature" column lists the outside temperature at the time of the shuttle launch.  A logistic regression model is considered with the following specification: 
$$Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$$
$$\text{Logit}(\pi_i):= \beta_0 +\beta_1 \times \text{`temperature'}.$$
Here the response variable $Y_i=1$ if there is a `O-Ring' failure corresponding to the $i^{\text{th}}$ data point.   Answer the parts of this questions based on the  following output from the R Statistical Software that is provided below:
