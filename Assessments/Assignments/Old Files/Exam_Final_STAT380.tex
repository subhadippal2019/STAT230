The covariates are {\bf ``intRate"} and  {\bf ``age"} that represents the corresponding {\bf interest rate} of the loan and the {\bf age} of the corresponding individual.   
We fit a following logistic regression model

$$\text{Logit}(\pi_i):= \beta_0 +\beta_1 \times \text{intRate}_i+ \beta_2 \times \text{age}_i.$$
