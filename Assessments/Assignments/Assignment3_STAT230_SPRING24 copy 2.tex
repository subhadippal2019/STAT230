A Wall Street analyst estimates that the annual return from the stock of company A can be
considered to be an observation from a normal distribution with mean $\mu =  8.0$ percent and standard
deviation $\sigma=  1.5$ percent. The analyst's investment choices are based upon the considerations that
any return greater than 5 percent is “satisfactory” and a return greater than 10 percents “excellent.” 
\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 points)  What is the probability that company A’s stock will prove to be “unsatisfactory” ?

\item \QuizQ{ \TextInBoxOne{5.4in}{
 The velocities of gas particles, denoted here by $V$,  can be modeled by the Maxwell distribution.  For simplicity of notations, consider the random variable $X$,  that refers to the square of the velocity, i.e. ,  $X=V^2$.   It can be shown that the  probability density functionof $X$ is given as 
$$f_{_X}(x):= \begin{cases}  4\pi \left( \frac{m}{2\pi KT} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}  \sqrt{x} \;  e^{- \left( \frac{m}{2KT} \right) x} & \text{ for } x>0, \\
0 & \text{ otherwise}. \end{cases}$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item( 5 points ) Identify the probability  distribution of the random variable $X$.
\item ( 8 points )  The kinetic energy of a particle is given by $\frac{1}{2}mV^2$.  Find the mean (expected value of the) kinetic energy for a particle.
