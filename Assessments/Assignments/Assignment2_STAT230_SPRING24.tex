\item \QuizQ{ \TextInBoxOne{5.4in}{
 Suppose that there is a practice session for a UAE football (soccer) team.   In that session all the 11 players randomly picked up a jersey from a basket where exactly 11 jerseys were kept.  Note that, all the jerseys have the players name written on it, therefore in the basket there were exactly one jersey that would match with a specific player.  What is the probability that none of the players have picked up the jersey that would match their name?

Three cards are selected randomly {\bf  without replacement} from the deck of 52 cards.

\item What is the probability that all the cards are  `Spades' ( $\spadesuit$)?
\item What is the probability that at least one of them is an `Ace'?

\item \QuizQ{ \TextInBoxOne{5.4in}{
(10 points ) A car repair can be performed either on time or late and either satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily. The probability
of a repair being on time and satisfactory is 0.26. The
probability of a repair being on time is 0.74. The
probability of a repair being satisfactory is 0.41. What is
the probability of a repair being late and unsatisfactory?

\item \QuizQ{ \TextInBoxOne{5.4in}{A typical ATM pin consists of 4 digits.  Assume that all the integers between $0$ to $9$ are equally likely for selecting each of the digits. Find the probability of the following events. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the total number of all possible different ATM PINs that a user can choose?
\item The bank has selected a group of 150 ATM users randomly.  What is the probability that atleast two of the users have exact same ATM pin? {\tiny \bf Assume that all the possible four digit numbers  are equally likely to be considered as a PIN of a randomly selected user.  Also, compute the probability upto 3 decimal places. }
