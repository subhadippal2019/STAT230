A car repair can be performed either on time or late and either satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily. The probability
of a repair being on time and satisfactory is 0.30. The
probability of a repair being on time is 0.75.  The
probability of a repair being satisfactory however it is performed late is 0.20.
